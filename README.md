This repository details our first adventures with LaTeX, otherwise known as a session entitled `A short Introduction to LaTeX: or LaTeX in 105 minutes`, originally for the 4th edition of the Oxford|Berlin summer school on Open Research taking place online on 20-23 September 2021 (Ox|Ber). It's going to be delivered as a combination of a more typical lecture style and a live-coding workshop, with short pauses for you to try and implement things as we go. Depending on the number of participants, we might split into groups of two and undertake `pair-programming' for the exercises. The entire workshop is contained within the .tex document, and also acts as a **very short** reference manual/cheat-sheet. There naturally needs to be some slight appreciation of the  self-awareness of a document of this type; it's teaching while it's also creating, all-in-one! Most importantly, this is a capacity building exercise for you; not to teach \textit{everything} about \LaTeX{}, but to empower you to learn how to become an expert typesetter in your own time.

The majority of the main content is found in `latex_in_105_minutes.tex`, which can be compiled through any major TeX engine. Files in `./supplementary/` are used as `\inputs{}` to this file.
